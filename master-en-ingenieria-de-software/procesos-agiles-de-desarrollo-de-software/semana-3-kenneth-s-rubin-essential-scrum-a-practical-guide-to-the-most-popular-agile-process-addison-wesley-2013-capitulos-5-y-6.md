# Semana 3 Kenneth S Rubin Essential Scrum A Practical Guide To The Most Popular Agile Process Addison Wesley 2013 Capitulos 5 Y 6


Scrum views requirements as an important degree of freedom. 

In Scrum instead of compiling a large inventory of detailed requirements up front, we create placeholders for the requirements, called **product backlog items** (PBIs)

Initially the product backlog items are large and with little detail but over time they become smaller and more detailed.

> Scrum doesn't specify any standard format for these product backlog items but many teams represent PBIs as user stories.

In scrum, we leverage conversartion as a key tool for ensuring that requirements are properly discussed and communicated.
