# Semana 3 Kenneth S Rubin Essential Scrum A Practical Guide To The Most Popular Agile Process Addison Wesley 2013 Capitulos 5 Y 6


Scrum views requirements as an important degree of freedom. 

> In Scrum instead of compiling a large inventory of detailed requirements up front, we create placeholders for the requirements, called **product backlog items** (PBIs)

Initially the product backlog items are large and with little detail but over time they become smaller and more detailed.

> Scrum doesn't specify any standard format for these product backlog items but many teams represent PBIs as user stories.

In scrum, we leverage conversations as a key tool for ensuring that requirements are properly discussed and communicated.

The product backlog is a "living document"

> In Scrum we use a a strategy of **progressive refinement** to dissagregate, in a just-in-time fashion, large, lightly detailed requirements into a set of smaller, more detailed items.

> User stories are a format for expressing the desired business value for many types of product backlog items, especially features, that are understable to both business and technical people.

What are user stories? :

Can be described as the 3 Cs: card, conversation and confirmation.

> **Card** : A common template format for this is to specify a class of user (the user role), what that class of user wants to achieve (the goal), and why the users want to achieve the goal. The "so that" part is optional but in general should be included. Example:

> As a typical user I want to see unbiased reviews of a restaurant near an address so that I can decide where to go for dinner.
{ .is-info }

> **Conversation** : The details of a requirement are exposed and communicated in a conversation among the  development  team,  product  owner,  and  stakeholders.  The  user  story  is  simply  a promise to have that conversation. The  conversation  is  typically  not  a one-time event, but rather an ongoing dialogue.

> **Confirmation**: A  user  story  also  contains  confirmation  information  in  the  form  of  conditions  of satisfaction.  These  are  acceptance  criteria  that  clarify  the  desired  behavior.  They are  used  by  the  development  team  to  better  understand  what  to  build  and  test  and by  the  product  owner  to  confirm  that  the  user  story  has  been  implemented  to  his satisfaction
