Video: Thinking about Quoins: Strategic Traceability of Architecturally Significant Requirements

Architectural degradation: Happens when the architecture gradually and persistently drifts from the original design. 

Traceability helps to identify and monitor the critical sensitivity points of this design so that maintaining don’t inadvertently degrade system qualities

Quoins (esquinas):  software systems change rapidly, as often architectural decision aren’t visible to developers decay and rot set in, because of that system qualities that are important to stakeholders erode. We must identify and expose the system quoins to the software developers who are responsible for maintaining the system. 

Software traceability presents a solution for tracking and exposing quoins, trace links can be established among key stakeholders concerns, architectural significant requirements, important architectural decisions and sections of code in which architectural decisions are implemented, this basic set of trace links means that developers working on sensitive areas of code, can stay informed of underlying architectural decisions and their associated requirements. This equip them to make informed changes. Traceability must be strategically planned, is not a good idea to trace every single requirement because is something costly and rigid.
